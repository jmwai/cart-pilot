## Demo Script

### [0:00-0:15] Introduction & Hook

**Visual**: Show the Cart Pilot interface

**Script**:
> "Meet Cart Pilot - an AI-powered shopping assistant that makes online shopping as natural as having a conversation. Instead of clicking through menus, you simply tell the AI what you're looking for, and it handles everything - from finding products to processing your order. Let me show you how it works."

**Action**: 
- Point to the chat interface
- Show the clean, modern UI

---

### [0:15-0:50] Product Discovery - Text Search

**Visual**: Type in chat, show search results

**Script**:
> "First, let's search for products. I'll ask for running shoes. Watch how the AI understands natural language - I don't need to use specific keywords or filters."

**Action**:
- Type: "Find me running shoes"
- Show the AI processing indicator
- Show product results appearing with images, names, and prices
- Point out the horizontal scrolling product cards

**Script** (continued):

**Action**:
- Upload an image (if feature available)

- Point out the visual similarity matching

**Script** (continued):

---

### [1:15-1:40] Add to Cart - Natural Language

**Visual**: Add product to cart using natural language

**Script**:
> "Now, adding items to your cart is just as natural. I don't need to click buttons or remember product IDs. I can just say 'add the blue ones' or 'add the first one'."

**Action**:
- Type: "Add the blue running shoes to my cart"
- Show the AI understanding which product
- Show cart updating in real-time
- Point out the cart artifact appearing

**Script** (continued):

---

### [1:40-2:10] Checkout Flow

**Visual**: Proceed through checkout

**Script**:

**Action**:
- Type: "Checkout"
- Show order summary appearing
- Point out order details, shipping address, total

**Script** (continued):
> "The AI has prepared my order summary with all the details. I can review everything before confirming."

---

### [2:10-2:45] Payment & Order Completion

**Visual**: Payment selection and order placement

**Script**:
> "Now for payment. The AI shows me available payment methods, and I can select one naturally. Once I confirm, the AI processes everything - creating payment mandates and placing the order automatically."

**Action**:
- Show payment method selection
- Type: "Use credit card" or select payment method
- Type: "Place order"

### [2:45-3:00] Wrap-up & Key Features

**Visual**: Show the completed order, highlight key features

**Script**:
> "Cart Pilot demonstrates the power of AI agents working together - a shopping agent orchestrates specialized sub-agents for product discovery, cart management, checkout, and payments. It's built with Google's Agent Development Kit and runs on Cloud Run, making it scalable and production-ready. The future of e-commerce is conversational, and Cart Pilot shows us how."

**Action**:
- Show order confirmation
- Highlight the conversational nature
- End with Cart Pilot logo/branding

## Troubleshooting During Demo

**If AI doesn't understand**:
- "The AI is learning - let me rephrase that"
- Try a simpler query

**If something breaks**:
- "Let me show you another example"
- Have backup scenarios ready

**If response is slow**:
- "The AI is processing your request - this is normal for complex queries"
- Use this time to explain what's happening behind the scenes

---

## Post-Production Notes

- Add captions/subtitles for accessibility
- Add background music (optional, keep it subtle)

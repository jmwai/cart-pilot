# How Product Recommendations Work

## Discover Products That Look Similar

When you're browsing a product, you'll see a section called "You Might Also Like" below the product details. These recommendations aren't random—they're powered by **visual similarity search**.

## What is Visual Similarity Search?

Visual similarity search uses **artificial intelligence** to understand what products look like, just like how you might recognize similar items when shopping in a store. Instead of comparing product names or descriptions, our system looks at the actual **images** of products to find items that are visually similar.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Understanding the Product Image
When you view a product, our system takes a look at the product's image. Using advanced AI technology, it creates a unique "fingerprint" or "signature" of the visual features—like colors, shapes, patterns, and style.

### Step 2: Finding Similar Products
This fingerprint is then compared against thousands of other products in our catalog. The system finds products whose images have similar visual characteristics—think of it like finding products that have a similar "look and feel."

### Step 3: Showing You the Best Matches
The products that are most visually similar to what you're viewing are shown in the "You Might Also Like" section. The closer the visual match, the higher they appear in the recommendations.

## What Makes Products Similar?

Products are considered similar based on:
- **Visual style** (modern, classic, minimalist, etc.)
- **Color schemes** (similar palettes or tones)
- **Shape and form** (curved, angular, organic, etc.)
- **Patterns and textures** (smooth, textured, patterned, etc.)
- **Overall aesthetic** (the general "feel" of the product)

## Why Use Visual Similarity?

Traditional search relies on keywords and descriptions, which can miss great matches. Visual similarity helps you discover products even when:
- Products have different names
- Descriptions use different words
- You're looking for something that "looks like" what you're viewing, even if it's a different category

## Privacy & Your Data

- **No personal information is used** - The system only looks at product images, not your browsing history or personal data
- **No tracking** - Your individual product views aren't stored or analyzed
- **Just the image** - Only the product's image is used to find similar items

## When Recommendations Might Vary

You might notice that recommendations can change or sometimes fall back to general suggestions. This can happen when:
- A product doesn't have an image available
- The system is temporarily unavailable
- There are very few visually similar products in our catalog

## Real-World Example

Imagine you're looking at a pair of blue running shoes:
- The system analyzes the image: blue color, athletic style, modern design
- It searches for products with similar visual features
- You might see: other blue athletic shoes, blue sneakers, or shoes with similar modern styling
- Even if they're different brands or have different names, they share that visual similarity
